# AXIOMA (Proof of Concept)

AXIOMA is a proof-of-concept for a **low-power, deterministic AI / compute core**
that transforms text or signals into **compact, verifiable results**.

This repository intentionally **does NOT contain the core source code**.

## Why no source code?
The AXIOMA core is proprietary intellectual property.
This repository exists to provide:
- a verifiable proof of concept
- a reproducible binary-based demo
- a clear public interface (API)
- benchmark evidence for low compute requirements

## Binary Execution
The AXIOMA binary is distributed via **GitHub Releases**.

1) Download `axioma_cli` from the latest release  
2) Make it executable (macOS / Linux):
```bash
chmod +x axioma_cli
3.	Quick test:./axioma_cli --input "Sowohl als auch is brilliant!"
Demo

See demo/run_demo.sh

Output Overview

Depending on the execution mode, AXIOMA returns:
	•	deterministic metrics (e.g. entropy, stability, coverage)
	•	a result commitment (hash)
	•	optional top-k summaries (public POC only, intentionally lossy)
